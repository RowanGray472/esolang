# esolang ![](https://github.com/RowanGray472/esolang/workflows/tests/badge.svg)

This is a small esolang for experimenting with creating syntax and semantics using the lark library in Python. I've implemented arithmetic, variables, if statements, conditionals, for loops, while loops, and functions.

Check out the doctests for example implementations!
