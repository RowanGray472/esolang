# esolang ![](https://github.com/RowanGray472/esolang/workflows/tests/badge.svg)

This is a small esolang for experimenting with creating syntax and semantics using the lark library in Python. I've implemented arithmetic, variables, if statements, conditionals, for loops, while loops, and functions. You can also make .esolang files to parse large amount of code at once.

Check out the doctests for example implementations!

Create .esolang files and parse them like this.

```
python3.11 run_esolang_file.py --level 3 test_program.esolang
```
